# ZK-Template
fork from `https://github.com/0xPARC/circom-starter`
A basic circom project using [Hardhat](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat) and [hardhat-circom](https://github.com/projectsophon/hardhat-circom). This combines the multiple steps of the [Circom](https://github.com/iden3/circom) and [SnarkJS](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs) workflow into your [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org) workflow.

By providing configuration containing your Phase 1 Powers of Tau and circuits, this plugin will:

1. Compile the circuits
2. Apply the final beacon
3. Output your `wasm` and `zkey` files
4. Generate and output a `Verifier.sol`


### Document
See the [source projects](https://github.com/projectsophon/hardhat-circom) for full documentation and configuration


## Install

`npm install` to install dependencies

## Development builds

`npm run circom:dev` to build deterministic development circuits.

Further, for debugging purposes, you may wish to inspect the intermediate files. This is possible with the `--debug` flag which the `circom:dev` task enables by default. You'll find them (by default) in `artifacts/circom/`

To build a single circuit during development, you can use the `--circuit` CLI parameter. For example, if you make a change to `hash.circom` and you want to _only_ rebuild that, you can run `npm run circom:dev --circuit hash`.

### Production builds

`npm run circom:prod` for production builds (using `Date.now()` as entropy)
